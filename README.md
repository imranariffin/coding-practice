# What is this?
This repository is where I *dump* my LeetCode Online Judge solutions. The solutions are a mix of original and derived solutions. Derived solutions are the ones that come from referring other people solutions across the Internet. I never copy and paste any of the derived solutions. For each of the derived solution, I will read and understand the algorithms. Then, I will try to implement them based on my understanding.

# Usage
Feel free to look at any of the solutions in this repo.

# Contributing
You can comment on any of my solutions that you think need improving.
